I am interested in the inﬂuence that abstract musical regularities might have on the perception of low-level acoustic information. The conversion of acoustic events into speciﬁc musical structures might not be a cognitive function restricted to music, and the processing of natural languages also relies on the depiction of acoustic information (i.e. phones) as meaningful idiomatic units (i.e. phonemes). 

For the next 5 years, I want to investigate how, where, and when acoustic events are encoded as musical and linguistic structures. I use behavioral, computational and neurophysiological methods to answer my research questions.
