My father is a pianist and I started studying music at the early age of 5. When I was about 12 years old, I switched to the electric guitar and started studying Jazz. I have always been fascinated by the art of improvisation, and have an unconditional love for brazilian music. 

Despite drifting away from performance, I continue to make contributions to musical comunity as a producer and as project manajer. I am currently managing projects for Guilherme Marcheto and for Pablo Contijo.
